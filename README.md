# Data Derby Team 10 - Data Mavericks 2023

This is the Data Mavericks team repository we used, to communicate our insights we gathered with each other during the datathon competition at the MN Data Derby 2023. We eventually ended up third in the Advanced competition. The task during this competition was to gather insights on food prices and inflation, including differences during the covid years and the start of the war in Ukraine. Besides gathering insides, we also got the task to forecast the food prices for the years 2023 and 2024, which we took even further up to 2030.
The complete task can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Neatherblok/Data_Mavericks_2023/tree/main/2023 Data Derby Challenge Questions.pdf">2023 Data Derby Challenge Questions</a> file.
